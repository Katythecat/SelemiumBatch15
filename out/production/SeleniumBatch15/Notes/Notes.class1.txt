Selenium Class 1

What is software testing?
-- identify correctness and quality of the application

How many ways can we actually test?
-- manual
-- automation

When do we go for automation?
-- after manual testing is passed
-- when environment is stable
-- analyze our test suite and choose our automation tools

What other tools do we know for automation?
-- Selenium, UFT/QTP, Cucumber, TestNG, Katalon Studio

Levels of testing?
-- Unit test
-- Acceptance testing
-- System testing
-- Integration testing

Types of Testing?
-- Functional testing
-- Non- Functional testing
    Performance testing
    Security testing

What is Selenium?
-- a set of tools which helps us to automate webb applications. It is mainly used
to perform functional testing.


What is Selenium WebDriver?
Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on a web application
WebDriver is an interface

Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-- open source
-- works with different programming languages--> Java Ruby, C#, JavaScript, Python
-- works with multiple browsers and supports cross browser testing
-- OS independent --> iOS, Linux, Windows

Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-- No technical support
-- Cannot test desktop applications
-- no built in reports
-- cannot test captchas, images, videos
-- takes more time to create test cases

get() vs navigate()
-- navigate can move back, forward and refresh
-- get() will wait for the page to fully load whereas navigate() will not
-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

close() vs quit()
-- close() will close the current tab
-- quit() will quit the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application



In case you need them for now...

Class 1 â€“ 21st of February

Selenium is a tool that helps you to do the automation of your websites.
It supports various browsers such as Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Edge.
It supports various programming languages such as Java, Ptython, C# etc.
Selenium Integration Steps:
   1)Create an IntelliJ Java Project!
   2)You downloaded the Selenium Package!
   3)You integrated the Selenium with IntelliJ!
   4)Download the ChromeDriver!
Testing your FIRST code (The Approach):
   1)Tell the project where your webdriver is located.
   2)We have to create an instance of the webdriver.
tip: Every project that is created has to be configured with JAR files and drivers.
Command:
   thread.sleep(3000);
      => it will show millis before 3000 as milliseconds.

Difference between driver.get and driver.navigate =>
   With navigate you can use driver.navigate().back(); command as well.
   driver.navigate().forward();
   driver.navigate().refresh();
GET will wait until the whole page is loaded.
NAVIGATE will NOT wait until the whole page is loaded.
There are two METHODS:
   1)driver.get();
   2)driver.navigate();

Difference between driver.close(); and driver.quit(); =>
   1)CLOSE will close the CURRENT tab.
   2)QUIT will close the WHOLE browser.

Window Size Management =>
   driver.manage().window().maximize();
   driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
